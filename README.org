#+TITLE: seafile.el

This Emacs extension aims to implement (parts of) version 2 of the
[[https://www.seafile.com/][Seafile]] [[http://manual.seafile.com/develop/web_api.html][Web API]].


* Motivation

My motivation for this is that I want to be able to upload single
files to a Seafile instance and create share links for them.  This
could then be used by a mail client for uploading large file
attachments in order to not sending the actual file via e-mail.


* Disclaimer

This is my very first take at Elisp programming, so things might be
ugly.  If you have any suggestions how to improve this code, I'm
grateful.

Also please not that currently this is not an Emacs extension but
rather a stand-alone program.  I will re-model it into an extension
once it does what it's supposed to to.
