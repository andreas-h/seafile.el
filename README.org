#+TITLE: seafile.el

This Emacs extension aims to upload single files to a [[https://www.seafile.com/][Seafile]] instance
and create share links for them.  To be used by a mail client for
uploading large file attachments in order to not sending the actual
file via e-mail.  It implements the necessasry parts from the [[http://manual.seafile.com/develop/web_api.html][Web API]]
of Seafile.

This is my very first take at Elisp programming, so things might be
ugly.  If you have any suggestions how to improve this code, I'm
grateful.

Also please not that currently this is not an Emacs extension but
rather a stand-alone program.  I will re-model it into an extension
once it does what it's supposed to to.
